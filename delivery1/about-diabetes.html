                <p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that 
                    affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the 
                    food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose)
                    and released into your bloodstream. When your blood 
                    sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. 
                    Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your 
                    body&apos;s cells for use as energy.

                <h2 class="sub-title">Diabetes has three types</h2>
                <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>
                    Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune 
                    reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake) that stops 
                    your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the 
                    people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 
                    diabetes often develop quickly. It&apos;s usually diagnosed 
                    in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 
                    diabetes, you&apos;ll need to take insulin every day to 
                    survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 
                    diabetes.
                </p>
                <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>
                    With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn&apos;t use insulin 
                    well and can&apos;t keep blood sugar at normal levels. 
                    About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It 
                    develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults 
                    (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). 
                    You may not notice any symptoms, so it&apos;s important to 
                    get your blood sugar tested if you&apos;re at risk. Type 2 
                    diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle 
                    changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and 
                    being active.
                </p>
                <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
                <p>
                    Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have 
                    never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your 
                    baby could be at higher risk for health problems. 
                    Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is 
                    born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in 
                    life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child 
                    or teen, and more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later 
                    in life too.
